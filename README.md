## Known Bugs
* Walking through doors not currently implemented
* Killing an enemy after they use projectiles causes the projectile to keep going continuously 
* Link gets pushed back when using sword on enemy (need to change sword hitbox)
* Swapping rooms with mouse can look weird if done quickly
* Enemy wall collision is still not quite right
* Some tiles can be walked through that shouldn't be
